# Stuyvesant Girls Who Code

Hello World! Greetings from Jackie and Tammy! We are the two co-presidents of Stuyvesant Girls Who Code for the 2019-2020 school year. You have stumbled upon our treasure trove of code! Visit our website [here](https://stuygwc2020.github.io)! There you will find more information about our club mission and structure. We update it weekly with new lessons. You will also find event signup forms, blog entries, and contact information on our site. Our, dear visitor, you may venture into our [CodeBits]() repo, where we store tidbits of code to be used for an activity!
