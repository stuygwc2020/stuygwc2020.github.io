				<h1> About Us </h1>
			</center>
			Stuyvesant’s Girls Who Code chapter is part of the national non-profit organization working to close the gender gap in technology. Through this club, we aim to educate, equip, and inspire girls, as well as guys, with the computing and technical skills they’ll need to pursue computer science as a passion or career. We host after school workshops to teach girls about computer science topics and skills beyond the classroom, such as competitive computing or data analytics, organize field trips to large tech companies like Google or Buzzfeed, as well as provide a supportive environment to encourage girls to continue pursuing STEM fields. We also frequently invite successful women in the tech industry to come to Stuy and speak at our meetings. Although members are not required to come to every workshop or every field trip, we hope that every Girls Who Code meeting gives girls the confidence they need to succeed in a traditionally male-dominated industry.
