				Stuyvesant’s <b>Girls Who Code chapter</b> is part of the national non-profit organization working to close the gender gap in technology. Through this club, we aim to<b> educate, equip, and inspire</b> girls, as well as guys, with the computing and technical skills they’ll need to pursue computer science as a passion or career. We host <b>after school workshops</b> to teach girls about computer science topics and skills beyond the classroom, such as competitive computing or data analytics, <b>organize field trips</b> to large tech companies like Google or Buzzfeed, as well as provide a supportive environment to encourage girls to continue pursuing STEM fields. We also frequently invite <b>successful women in the tech industry</b> to come to Stuy and speak at our meetings. Although members are not required to come to every workshop or every field trip, we hope that every Girls Who Code meeting gives girls the <b>confidence</b> they need to succeed in a traditionally male-dominated industry.
				<br> <br>
				Although the statistics at Stuy are slightly better than nationwide, there is still a huge drop in the retention rate for females progressing from Intro2 to AP Computer Science. Research has shown that <b>effective mentorship</b> early on for aspiring female computer scientists can significantly increase their desire and confidence in staying in this typically male-dominated field. The <b>main goal</b> of this club is to provide that mentorship for many females pursuing computer science for the first time. We host workshops, Q and A sessions, and field trips to expose girls to computer science beyond the classroom and hopefully, inspire them to consider computer science as a career. In addition, Girls Who Code is a great way for girls to network with each other and with other successful computer scientists to establish some ground in the industry early on. We also hope that having upperclassmen Student Leaders, many who have succeeded in the Stuyvesant computer science courses, guiding them through the process will encourage them to keep taking computer science courses throughout their Stuy careers. In short, the purpose of Girls Who Code is to <b>benefit the minority of females in computer science and close the gender gap in STEM fields</b> overall.
				<br> <br>
				Girls Who Code is <b>unique</b> because we are one of few clubs that use learning and academics to address <b>social injustice</b>. The biggest problem for women in STEM is the inability to fit in with other programmers, and we believe that education early on is key for their retention in this field. Although there are quite a lot of computer science clubs, our organization is one of few that <b>uses our responsibilities</b> as a school club to <b>address larger social issues</b>.
