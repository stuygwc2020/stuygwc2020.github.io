				<h1> About Us </h1>

				Stuyvesant’s <b>Girls Who Code chapter</b> is part of the national non-profit organization working to close the gender gap in technology. Through this club, we aim to<b> educate, equip, and inspire</b> girls with the computing and technical skills they’ll need to pursue computer science.
				<br><br>
				Although the statistics at Stuy are slightly better than nationwide statistics, there is still a huge decrease in the retention rate for females progressing from introductory CS courses to AP CS. Research has shown that <b>effective mentorship</b> early on for aspiring female computer scientists can significantly impact their desire to stay in the field. The <b>main goal</b> of this club is to provide that mentorship for females pursuing computer science for the first time.
				<br><br>
				We host <b>after school workshops</b> to teach girls about computer science topics and skills beyond the classroom, such as competitive computing or data analytics, arrange Q and A sessions, and organize <b>field trips</b> to large tech companies like Google or Buzzfeed. We also frequently invite <b>successful women in the tech industry</b> to come to Stuy and speak at our meetings. Upperclassmen serve as student leaders to provide a supportive environment that encourages girls to continue pursuing computer science. It is our goal to make sure that every girl walks away from a Girls Who Code meeting having gained some of the <b>confidence</b> they need to succeed in a male-dominated industry.
				<br><br>
				Girls Who Code is <b>unique</b> because we are one of few clubs that uses learning and academics to address <b>social inequality</b>. We believe that exposure early on is the key to higher retention rates for females in computer science. Although there are many other computer science clubs, our organization is one of few that <b>uses our platform</b> as a school club to <b>address larger social issues</b>.
