					<h1 color="#555">Speaking with Ed Cotler</h1>
					<hr>
					<p id="date" style="font-style:italic; text-align:center;">Monday, February 24th</p>
					Today, Girls Who Code @ Stuy met Edward ‚ÄúEd‚Äù Cotler: a very accomplished Stuyvesant
					alumni and the founder of Gotham Crypto. He explained to us what blockchains were and how
					they worked, but we also gained quality business advice from him as well. Ed explained to us
					that we should only work for a project that we believe in and that we should be careful with who
					we have as advisors as we should get complimentary voices on a team. Then, to further our
					understanding of blockchains, we did a case study together involving tokenomics. We ended on
					the note that although right now at Stuy, it seems that everyone is in competition with each other
					to strive for 100%, in the real world, we have to learn from each other and build upon each
					other‚Äôs works because math and sciences are complicated and no one truly knows 100% of
					everything.

					<p id="date" style="font-style:italic; text-align:center;">Wednesday, February 12th</p>
					Today, Girls Who Code @ Stuy went on a trip to TwoSigma, a financial investment hedge fund
					that is also very techy. They showed us their ‚ÄúHackerLab‚Äù which was a place where they could
					come up with ideas and just play around with them. They also restored old computers there as
					well and followed the motto ‚ÄúBecause why not?‚Äù when questioned the reason for their projects.
					We then headed over to the conference room where we met women who worked in the company
					with jobs ranging from software engineer to product designer. Over pizza and soda, we had a
					Q&A session with them where we learned about their experiences in CS and gained advice for
					our own futures.

					<h1 color="#555">Scavenger Hunt</h1>
					<hr>
					<p id="date" style="font-style:italic; text-align:center;">Friday, December 20th</p>
					Today, Girls Who Code @ Stuy hosted their annual end-of-the-year Scavenger Hunt. There were two parts to the hunt, one online and one physical. The hunt consisted of clues that participants had to solve using what they've learned in Girls Who Code this semester, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, terminal commands and more! After successfully completing the scavenger hunt, participants were rewarded with a rubber ducky. There was also a party to celebrate the upcoming holidays after the event in room 301. Girls Who Code will resume the second Friday after break (there's a fun little lesson planned!). Exciting things coming second semester!

					<p id="date" style="font-style:italic; text-align:center;">Tuesday, December 17th</p>
					Today, Girls Who Code @ Stuy met Caitlin Stanton: a Stuyvesant alumni who has made major strides for women in tech. Caitlin brought us through her journey into tech and spoke about her introduction into the workforce, projects that she has worked on and key points that she lives by. She also told us about her life at Cornell including information about her major, Electrical and Computer Engineering and some of her key points that have gotten her through college include finding a support system, stepping out of your comfort zone and taking care of yourself. At the end, she had a Q & A session, including giving us advice about how to build ourselves up as women in tech.

					<hr>
					<p id="date" style="font-style:italic; text-align:center;">Wednesday, December 4th</p>
					During today‚Äôs event, Girls Who Code @ Stuy met Minerva Tantoco: an incredibly accomplished woman who has done everything from founding a startup to creating a bank. Throughout the event, she described the trajectory of her career and her work as CTO of New York City. She told us about her focus on inclusivity and ethics and elaborated on one of her projects, LinkNYC (the free-wifi kiosks on the street!) and how inclusivity played a major role in this project. She also had a Q & A section answering all of our questions and told us about her day-to-day life, her motivations for her projects: the gender disparity in tech and the importance of fixing it.

					<h1 color="#555">Speaking with Isabel Abonitalla</h1>
					<hr>
					<p id="date" style="font-style:italic; text-align:center;">Monday, November 18th</p>
					During today's event, Isabel Abonitalla described her experience with CS, her classes, and hackathons. She talked about how computer science was not her first major in college, but she fell in love with it during an internship. One of the biggest takeaways from the lecture was the fact that anyone can play a role in computer science no matter what field they are in. Isabel also told us about the classes she was taking at Hunter College, and gave us a brief overview of hackathons and a project she made during a hackathon. Her favorite thing about hackathons is that they are more hands-on than regular classes, and you always leave one with a full-fledged project. Finally, she answered any remaining questions or concerns we had about women working in the field of computer science.
