						<b>Description:</b> Stuyvesant Girls Who Code will be hosting their first guest speaker! Isabel Abonitalla is a junior at Hunter College studying computer science and bioinformatics. She is the Director of Internal Affairs and Operations of HAX, a non-profit dedicated to providing hackathons to women across the country, as well as an experienced front-end developer and product manager. She is proficient in several languages, including R, Python and HTML/CSS, and has created several personal projects that tackle issues such as mental health and environmental sustainability. She is excited to share her journey with technology inside and outside of school and give advice on developing personal projects.

					During today's event, Isabel Abonitalla described her experience with CS, her classes, and hackathons. She talked about how computer science was not her first major in college, but she fell in love with it during an internship. One of the biggest takeaways from the lecture was the fact that anyone can play a role in computer science no matter what field they are in. Isabel also told us about the classes she was taking at Hunter College, and gave us a brief overview of hackathons and a project she made during a hackathon. Her favorite thing about hackathons is that they are more hands-on than regular classes, and you always leave one with a full-fledged project. Finally, she answered any remaining questions or concerns we had about women working in the field of computer science.
