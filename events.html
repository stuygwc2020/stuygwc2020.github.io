					<hr>
					<p id="date" style="font-style:italic; text-align:center;">Wednesday, December 4th</p>
					During today’s event, Girls Who Code @ Stuy met Minerva Tantoco: an incredibly accomplished woman who has done everything from founding a startup to creating a bank. Throughout the event, she described the trajectory of her career and her work as CTO of New York City. She told us about her focus on inclusivity and ethics and elaborated on one of her projects, LinkNYC (the free-wifi kiosks on the street!) and how inclusivity played a major role in this project. She also had a Q & A section answering all of our questions and told us about her day-to-day life, her motivations for her projects: the gender disparity in tech and the importance of fixing it.

					<p id="date" style="font-style:italic; text-align:center;">Monday, November 18th</p>
					During today's event, Isabel Abonitalla described her experience with CS, her classes, and hackathons. She talked about how computer science was not her first major in college, but she fell in love with it during an internship. One of the biggest takeaways from the lecture was the fact that anyone can play a role in computer science no matter what field they are in. Isabel also told us about the classes she was taking at Hunter College, and gave us a brief overview of hackathons and a project she made during a hackathon. Her favorite thing about hackathons is that they are more hands-on than regular classes, and you always leave one with a full-fledged project. Finally, she answered any remaining questions or concerns we had about women working in the field of computer science.
