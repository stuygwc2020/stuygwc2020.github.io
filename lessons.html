						<h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
						<hr>
						<p id="date">
							October 11th, 2019
						</p>
						<p>
							Today, we touched upon the basics of HTML. We looked at the features a website contained and went over the HTML syntax needed to build those features. We learned how to write headings, add links and images, make lists, and create tables. Next, we played a fun game of Kahoot!, which tested us on all the syntax we had just learned. Finally, we worked on a webpage about ourselves as part of our closing activity.
