						<h1 style="color:crimson;">CS @ Stuy Panel</h1>
						<hr>
						<p id="date">
							February 7th, 2020
						</p>
						<p>
							We kicked off the first meeting of second semester by introducing the computer science department at Stuyvesant. Sophomores are required to take an introductory CS course, in the form of either Intro CS (one semester) or Annual CS (two semesters). In Intro CS, students learn about Racket and NetLogo; Annual students learn Python and HTML. We stressed the importance of taking Annual CS if you have even a slight interest in computer science. Then, the presidents demoed Pac-Man from the NetLogo Model Library and further elaborated on the visual differences between NetLogo and Racket. We then dived into AP CS, a course open to juniors and seniors. The APCS curriculum is taught in Java and focuses on object-oriented programming and utilizing problem-solving skills. We learned that the entire CollegeBoard APCS curriculum is taught in the fall semester, while data structures and algorithms are taught in the spring semester. Annual CS prepares students better for APCS; however, it is still possible for Intro students to take APCS. Afterwards, we demoed Tammy and Jenny’s APCS Project, a remake of the game Plants vs Zombies. Afterwards, we talked about several post-APCS electives: Software Development, System Level Programming, Computer Graphics, Artificial Intelligence, and a new elective coming next year, Cybersecurity. Jackie demoed the projects she made in her Software Development class, including a TriviaCrack project that quizzed users on a wide range of topics and a casino game, which allowed the user to play Blackjack and scratch lottery tickets. She said that Software Development strengthened her project management and teamwork skills as well as her understanding of web-based applications and full-stack development. Afterwards, Tammy talked about her experience in System Level Programming. Tammy clarified System Level Programming was about C (a low-level programming language), development in the Linux environment, the main components of a computer, and networking (server and client programs). Next, we talked about Computer Graphics, an animation course that allows you to understand and use motion description, lighting and shading, animation, ray tracing, and graphics algorithms. Finally, we talked about Artificial Intelligence, a course that discusses the ethics of AI as well as topics such as neural networks. We wrapped up the lesson by talking about CS programs outside of Stuy. One well-known program is called GWC Summer Immersion, a free, 7-week computer course that teaches a wide variety of coding languages through lessons, guest speakers, and trips. Additionally, once you complete the course, you gain access to the GWC alumni network. Next, we learned about a project-based program hosted by Cooper Union. The first 2 weeks of this 6-week program focused on web development in order to create a fully functional web application which tackles a UN Sustainable Developmental Goal. Finally, we learned about the BNY Mellon internship, which immerses participants in the corporate world of computer science and teaches networking skills. We then briefly talked about several other programs such as Kode with Klossy and the Brown Scholars CS Program. At the end of the meeting, the board reminded everyone that Mr. Blumm’s Opportunities Bulletin is a great resource for finding summer programs.

						<h1 style="color:cornflowerblue;">Minecraft Redstone</h1>
						<hr>
						<p id="date">
							January 10th, 2020
						</p>
						<p>
							Kicking off our first meeting of 2020, we learned about Minecraft Redstoning. George first explained Redstone was electricity in minecraft. We then went on a website that demonstrated the uses of Redstone in minecraft from a bird’s eye view. Afterwards, we learned how redstone torches supply electricity, levers allow the player to control the electricity, and buttons allow the player to release short bursts of electricity. Afterwards, we learned how to delete blocks in the simulator. We figured out the maximum length of a signal is 15 blocks, so we would need repeaters to strengthen the signal. We then used our knowledge to build simple contraptions.

						</p>
						<p>
							In today’s lesson, we continued learning styling in Javascript. We also learned how to create buttons and code functions, such as the average function and addition function. At the end of the lesson, we played a mini game similar to Super Mario Bros made using Javascript and HTML.

						<h1 style="color:crimson;">Intro to Javascript</h1>
						<hr>
						<p id="date">
							December 6th, 2019
						</p>
						<p>
							In today's lesson, we learned more about styling in JavaScript. We refreshed the commands we learned in terminal from the previous lesson. Furthermore, we also learned how to create and use HTML buttons and call functions. Functions are code for a particular task, and prevents the coder from having to rewrite code. The first function we learned was getElementById, which we used to change pieces of text, colors of text, and photos. By the end of the lesson we added interactive buttons to our website and added alerts throughout the code. We ended the lesson by playing a mini game coded entirely in JavaScript.

						<h1 style="color:cornflowerblue;">Terminal Commands</h1>
						<hr>
						<p id="date">
							November 22nd, 2019
						</p>
						<p>
							Today, our advisor Lena gave a lesson on terminal commands. We learned several terminologies including command, terminal, directory, argument, and option. After that, we learned different types of commands we could use in terminal such as ls and cd. The commands helped us understand how to move, create, view, edit, delete, and open files in terminal. We also learned several shortcuts which would make coding quicker and easier. Towards the end of the lesson, Lena showed fun graphics (including a Star Wars movie in the terminal) that were precoded in terminal. We ended the lesson by exploring a terminal adventure game made by MIT.

						<h1 style="color:cadetblue;">CSS Continued</h1>
						<hr>
						<p id="date">
							November 15th, 2019
						</p>
						<p>
							Today, we continued applying CSS to our HTML websites. We started off by learning about the three methods to add colors in CSS: name, RGB values, and hex values. We also learned how to add comments into our stylesheets. We focused mostly on using hex values and to solidify our understanding, we played a game called Hex Invaders. We then learned about organization in HTML, using div tags to separate content into different sections. We also learned to add class and ID attributes to our HTML tags, which allows for more versatile styling. We ended the meeting with CSS practice from CodeAcademy. Additionally, we announced our first guest speaker, Isabel Abonitalla!

							November 8th, 2019
						</p>
						<p>
							Today, we learned how to style our HTML pages using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). We used Inspect Element to examine the styling of other websites. Afterwards, we learned the syntax of CSS and the three methods of implementing it. We learned about inline styling, which is directly inside HTML tags, internal stylesheet, which is written inside a style tag, and external stylesheet, which is situated in a CSS file and linked to the HTML code. We then learned about other properties we can modify in CSS, such as font-size, color, background-color, border-radius and width. We ended the meeting with a fun game of Kahoot!

						<h1 style="color:cornflowerblue;">HTML Review</h1>
						<hr>
						<p id="date">
							November 1st, 2019
						</p>
						<p>
							Today, we tested out the guest GWC accounts for the first time! We continued making our own HTML pages and learned how to add comments. Jackie briefly re-taught what HTML attributes were and how to use them. Lastly, we learned how to use inspect element. Inspect element allows the user to temporarily view and edit the code on a webpage. Using our knowledge of inspect element, we extracted information from study.com and enotes. By deleting code that hid information, we were able to access information that was previously unavailable . We ended with a text adventure game made by Google that is available through inspect element.

						</p>
						<p>
							Today, we learned more about HTML, beginning with an opening activity on creating a page about ourselves. We then discussed Attributes, which are added to tags to modify properties and behaviors. Finally, we talked about how to organize HTML code, namely through comments, div and span, and Class and IDs. We did not manage to finish the lesson and will be continuing it at the next meeting, which is in two weeks (next week is PTC).

						<hr>
						<p id="date">
							October 11th, 2019
						</p>
						<p>
							Today, we touched upon the basics of HTML. We looked at the features a website contained and went over the HTML syntax needed to build those features. To name a few examples, we learned how to write headings, add links and images, make lists, and create tables. Next, we played a fun game of Kahoot!, which tested us on all the syntax we had just learned. Finally, we worked on a webpage about ourselves as part of our closing activity.
