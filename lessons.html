							Today, we learned more about HTML, beginning with an opening activity on creating a page about ourselves. We then discussed Attributes, which are added to tags to modify properties and behaviors. Finally, we talked about how to organize HTML code, namely through comments, div and span, and Class and IDs. We did not manage to finish the lesson and will be continuing it at the next meeting, which is in two weeks (next week is PTC).

							Today, we touched upon the basics of HTML. We looked at the features a website contained and went over the HTML syntax needed to build those features. To name a few examples, we learned how to write headings, add links and images, make lists, and create tables. Next, we played a fun game of Kahoot!, which tested us on all the syntax we had just learned. Finally, we worked on a webpage about ourselves as part of our closing activity.
