							Today, we learned how to style our HTML pages using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). We used Inspect Element to examine the styling of other websites. Afterwards, we learned the syntax of CSS and the three methods of implementing it. We learned about inline styling, which is directly inside HTML tags, internal stylesheet, which is written inside a style tag, and external stylesheet, which is situated in a CSS file and linked to the HTML code. We then learned about other properties we can modify in CSS, such as font-size, color, background-color, border-radius and width. We ended the meeting with a fun game of Kahoot!

							Today, we tested out the guest GWC accounts for the first time! We continued making our own HTML pages and learned how to add comments. Jackie briefly re-taught what HTML attributes were and how to use them. Lastly, we learned how to use inspect element. Inspect element allows the user to temporarily view and edit the code on a webpage. Using our knowledge of inspect element, we extracted information from study.com and enotes. By deleting code that hid information, we were able to access information that was previously unavailable . We ended with a text adventure game made by Google that is available through inspect element.

							Today, we learned more about HTML, beginning with an opening activity on creating a page about ourselves. We then discussed Attributes, which are added to tags to modify properties and behaviors. Finally, we talked about how to organize HTML code, namely through comments, div and span, and Class and IDs. We did not manage to finish the lesson and will be continuing it at the next meeting, which is in two weeks (next week is PTC).

						<p>
							Today, we touched upon the basics of HTML. We looked at the features a website contained and went over the HTML syntax needed to build those features. To name a few examples, we learned how to write headings, add links and images, make lists, and create tables. Next, we played a fun game of Kahoot!, which tested us on all the syntax we had just learned. Finally, we worked on a webpage about ourselves as part of our closing activity.
